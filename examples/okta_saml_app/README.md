# okta_saml_app

This resource represents an Okta SAML Application in various configuration states. For more information see the [API docs](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/resources/apps#add-custom-saml-application)

## Preconfigured Applications

It should be noted that Okta does not provide an API endpoint to configure "preconfigured" SAML apps such as AWS so they can only be created and slightly configured. You cannot enable API Integrations. This is the only known limitation as of now.
